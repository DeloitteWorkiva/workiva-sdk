    post:

        Retrieves a URL that can be used to upload an image, and an operationId to track the image upload progress. Once uploaded, the image can be inserted in content.

        Image uploads must conform to the following constraints:

        - An image must be uploaded once per usage in content.
        - Image uploads must complete within ten minutes.
        - The file size of the uploaded image must 75 MB or smaller.
        - The total number of pixels in the uploaded image must be 50 Megapixels or smaller.
        - The image must be inserted in content within 24 hours or it will be removed.

        Responses include an `uploadUrl` which indicates where to upload the image. To upload the file,
        perform a PUT against the `uploadUrl` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the import request.
        For more details, see [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication). The response will also include
        a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for results. For more details on long-running job polling, see
        [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid). When the upload completes, its status will be
        `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`.

        Create a new [`Anchor`](ref:content#anchor) using a [`RichTextAnchorCreation`](ref:content#richtextanchorcreation) request. This is a long running operation.

        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for
        results. For more details on long-running job polling, see
        [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid).
        When the creation completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response
        body includes a `resourceURL`. To GET the new rich text anchor, perform a GET
        on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the
        initial request. For more details, see
        [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

        Create a new [`Anchor`](ref:content#anchor) using a [`TableAnchorCreation`](ref:content#tableanchorcreation) request. This is a long running operation.

        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for
        results. For more details on long-running job polling, see
        [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid).
        When the creation completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response
        body includes a `resourceURL`. To GET the new table anchor, perform a GET
        on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the
        initial request. For more details, see
        [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

      description: |
        Create a new [`Milestone`](ref:milestones#milestone) using a [`MilestoneCreation`](ref:milestones#milestonecreation) request. This is a long running operation. Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for results. For more details on long-running job polling, see [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid). When the creation completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`. To GET the new milestone, perform a GET on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the initial request. For more details, see [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

        Similar to an organization admin's "People View" export, this returns a paged list of specific details about the organization's users, including their usernames, display names, email addresses, SAML IDs, last logins, workspace memberships, licenses and roles. Results are sorted by displayName. <br /><br /> To obtain an organization's users, you need its organizationId. To view the organizationId in Wdesk, click your name in the lower left, and select <strong>Organization Admin</strong>. In the URL in your browser, the organizationId appears as a GUID after the /o/ such as 371b5fc8-fcc4-404a-9d22-d07d8f46a7e0. To view the ID of another organization you manage, select <strong>Switch Organizations</strong> from the left-hand menu, and search for and select the organization. <br /><br /> <strong>Requires the calling user to be an organization admin</strong>.

        Include the client_id and client_secret in the body of the request as form encoded parameters. For example, the body of the request would be `grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>`. The client can optionally specify a `scope` parameter to limit the scope of the returned [access token](ref:helpers#bearertoken). In turn, the server uses a `scope` response parameter to inform the client of the scope of the actual access token issued. The actual `scope` returned may not match the `scope` requested. Subsequent requests to Workiva APIs are authorized using the bearer token.

        ### Examples

        #### Add a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity",
            "value": "Workiva"
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Remove a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "remove",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity"
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Replace a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity",
            "value": "Workiva, Inc."
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Verifying customFieldGroup is empty before replacing the list

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "test",
            "path": "/customFieldGroups",
            "value": []
          },
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/customFieldGroups",
            "value": ["gsr.reporting"]
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Adding a customFieldGroup to the end of a list

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "add",

        Asynchronously exports a [document](ref:documents#document) as .PDF or .DOCX., or .XHTML. Options are specified using a [DocumentExport](ref:documents#documentexport) object.
        When exporting XHTML that you plan to edit or modify, use the `editableXhtml` option. Otherwise, the export retains fidelity so it visually matches the document as it appears in the browser.
        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for export results. For more details on long-running job polling, see [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid). When the export completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`. To download the exported file, perform a GET on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the export request.

        Asynchronously exports a graph report (only CSV available at this time).
        This endpoint will execute the query of a saved report and export to the specified format (only CSV available at this time). The ID of the [record](ref:graph#record) containing the saved report is used for the `reportID` path element. Reports are stored in records of type `DataSource` and `ReportView`. The list of applicable records can be retrieved from the `/records` endpoint such as `GET /records?$filter=type eq DataSource or type eq ReportView`. A filter on the `title` property should be used to return a particular report.
        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for export results. For more details on long-running job polling, see [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid). When the export completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`. To download the exported file, perform a GET on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the export request. For more details, see [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

        which indicates where to poll for results. For more details on long-running
        job polling, see [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid).


        ### Options

        | Path                              | PATCH Operations Supported         |
        |-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
        | `/customFields/<custom field id>` | `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `test` |
        | `/customFieldGroups`              | `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `test` |
        | `/slideCustomFieldGroups`         | `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `test` |

        ### Examples

        #### Add a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity",
            "value": "Workiva"
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Remove a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "remove",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity"
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Replace a custom field value

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/customFields/com.workiva.gsr.legal_entity",
            "value": "Workiva, Inc."
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Verifying customFieldGroup is empty before replacing the list

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "test",
            "path": "/customFieldGroups",
            "value": []

          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/customFieldGroups",
            "value": ["gsr.reporting"]
          }
        ]
        ```

        #### Adding a customFieldGroup to the end of a list

        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for export results. For more details on long-running job polling, see [ Operations endpoint ](ref:getoperationbyid). When the export completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`. To download the exported file, perform a GET on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the export request. For more details, see [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

      description: Asynchronously upserts an array of [datasets](ref:spreadsheets#dataset) to a [spreadsheet](ref:spreadsheets#spreadsheet), given their properties. Each [sheet](ref:spreadsheets#sheet) can have only one dataset, and its range will always start with `A1`. <br /><br /> Bulk upsertion creates or updates datasets in sheets and performs any calculations after it completes. When complete, the dataset's range is locked through both the UI and endpoints that write values to a sheet. To change the values in a dataset, either upsert new values using this endpoint again, or delete the dataset. <br /><br /> If any dataset fails to upsert, no datasets upsert, and no changes commit. <br /><br /> Each dataset in the array requires `sheet` and `values`. Partial upserts are not supported. <br /><br /> Values may be strings, numbers, integers, or booleans. To indicate an empty cell, provide an empty string.

        Responses include a `Location` header, which indicates where to poll for export results. For more details on long-running job polling, see [Operations endpoint](ref:getoperationbyid). When the export completes, its status will be `completed`, and the response body includes a `resourceURL`. To download the exported file, perform a GET on the `resourceURL` with the same authentication credentials and flow as the export request. For more details, see [Authentication documentation](ref:authentication).

        Note: To export to .PDF, the spreadsheet can have no more than 250,000 cells.

        Asynchronously copies a [sheet](ref:spreadsheets#sheet) given details about the copy's destination within the same or another spreadsheet. Options are specified using a [SheetCopy](ref:spreadsheets#sheetcopy) object.

        This endpoint copies a sheet's content, but does not copy labels, comments, or tasks. It will copy over most formatting, however it does not copy user-defined style guides across spreadsheets. So if the source sheet has  formatting that depends on a user-defined style guide, that formatting will be lost when copying to a new spreadsheet.

        Unless otherwise specified, the copy appears at the top level of its  destination spreadsheet, with an index of 0, and with the same name as the original sheet.

    Revision:
      description: |
        Identifies a unique revision of content. The same revision can be used for any content request within a file because revisions are allocated at the file-level.
        When querying for content, this can be used to get a consistent version of the content. When editing content, this can be used to make the change to the content at a known state. In either case, omitting the revision (when allowed) will always default to the latest revision of the file.

            Whether the edits in a batch should be isolated from one-another. The edits will still be applied in order, but subsequent edits are unaffected by the previous edits in the same batch. For example, if one edit inserts some content, the next edits will act as if the content doesn't exist yet. Or if an edit deletes some content, the next edits will act as if the content is still there. This mode makes it easier to apply many edits on existing content because you don't need to manually keep track of how the previous edits have moved the content.

The edits will still be applied in order, but subsequent edits are unaffected by the previous edits in the same batch. For example, if one edit inserts some content, the next edits will act as if the content doesn't exist yet. Or if an edit deletes some content, the next edits will act as if the content is still there. This mode makes it easier to apply many edits on existing content because you don't need to manually keep track of how the previous edits have moved the content. For example, if you want to replace all instances of one word with another it will be easier to do this with isolated edits.

            Whether the edits in a batch should be isolated from one-another. The edits will still be applied in order, but subsequent edits are unaffected by the previous edits in the same batch. For example, if one edit inserts some content, the next edits will act as if the content doesn't exist yet. Or if an edit deletes some content, the next edits will act as if the content is still there. This mode makes it easier to apply many edits on existing content because you don't need to manually keep track of how the previous edits have moved the content. For example, if you want to replace all instances of one word with another it will be easier to do this with isolated edits.
