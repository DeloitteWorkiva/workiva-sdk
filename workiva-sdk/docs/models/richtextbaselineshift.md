# RichTextBaselineShift

Indicates the offset from the baseline of the characters. The baseline is the imaginary bottom line for a line of text which the bottom of the characters are placed, not including any descender such as g, j, p, and y have. `superscript` shifts the baseline up and reduces the rendered font size to 65% of the specified font size. `subscript` works the same as `superscript` except it moves the baseline down. `baseline` uses the default size and baseline for regular text. type: string
